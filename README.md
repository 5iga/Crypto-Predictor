# Crypto-Predictor
This is my first data science and machine learning project using python. The program utilizes CoinAPI to retrieve crypto price history and uses logistic regression to make predictions about future prices. The actual prices and predicted prices are visualized using matplotlib for comparison.

Getting Started
To use this program, you will need to obtain an API key from CoinAPI. This key is used to access the price history data for the cryptocurrency of your choice.

Install
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:
NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

Logistic Regression Model
The logistic regression model is used to make predictions about future prices. This model is trained using historical price data and makes predictions based on that information.

Visualization with Matplotlib
The actual prices and predicted prices are visualized using matplotlib. This allows for easy comparison between the two and helps to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the directory that contains the file crypto_pred.py and run the following command:
python crypto_pred.py

Future Improvements
This program is a work in progress and will continue to be improved over time. Future changes may include the use of more advanced machine learning models and the integration of additional data sources to further improve the accuracy of the predictions.
